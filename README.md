# File Manager
File Manager is a file management system written in Python that monitors a specified directory and organizes its files into pre-designated folders by corresponding file type.

It currently supports audio, video, image, compressed, executable, document and torrent file types.

# Usage
Currently, the directory to monitor is stored within the filesorter.py file under the `orig` variable.
The paths files should be sorted to are stored in the `sorted_path_dict` dictionary.
